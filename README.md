# Wingstats

Wingstats aims to be an open-source application for all major platforms to analyze statistics about the Wingspan games you have played.

## Planned Features

We have a lot of features in mind that we would like to implement. The app we envision will allow you to:

- Generate interesting statistics about your wingspan games
- Add your game stats manually or by taking photos of your scoresheets
- Automatically score parts of your game by taking a photo of the ending game state

## Current State of Development

Nothing substantial has been implemented yet.
