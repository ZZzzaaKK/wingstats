# Wingstats

Wingstats aims to be an open-source application for all major platforms to analyze statistics about the Wingspan games you have played.

## Planned Features

We have a lot of features in mind that we would like to implement. The app we envision will allow you to:

- Generate interesting statistics about your wingspan games
- Add your game stats manually or by taking photos of your scoresheets
- Automatically score parts of your game by taking a photo of the ending game state

## Current State of Development

Nothing substantial has been implemented yet.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

Follow the instructions [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) to get tauri running. You will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already.

### Installation

First clone the git repository to a local directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZZzzaaKK/wingstats
```
Next, change directory to the new one you just created.
```bash
cd wingstats
```
Finally, it should be possible to run the app with:
```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

If things worked out, the app should have popped up for you now!

## Troubleshooting

Please file an issue or message the contributors if you encounter any issues.
